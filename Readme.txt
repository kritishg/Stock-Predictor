Project Description:Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM Neural Networks

Overview
This project aims to predict the stock prices using historical daily stock data from 2010 to 2019, leveraging a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting. The project integrates data acquisition from the Alpha Vantage API, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and future price prediction. By analyzing historical closing prices and employing deep learning techniques, the model seeks to capture temporal patterns in the stock market data to forecast future prices with reasonable accuracy.

Objectives
1. **Data Acquisition**: Retrieve reliable historical stock data for AAPL using the Alpha Vantage API, a robust alternative to traditional sources like Yahoo Finance.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, scale, and structure the data into sequences suitable for time series modeling.
3. **Model Development**: Build and train an LSTM-based neural network to predict future stock prices based on past trends.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
5. **Visualization**: Provide intuitive visualizations of actual vs. predicted prices and historical trends with moving averages.
6. **Future Prediction**: Enable single-day-ahead price predictions based on the most recent data.
7. **Result Storage**: Save prediction results for further analysis or deployment.

Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   - The project uses the Alpha Vantage API to fetch daily adjusted stock data for AAPL from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2019.  
   - Key data points include Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume, though the model primarily focuses on the `Close` price for predictions.  
   - The API request is designed to handle errors gracefully, with fallback logic (though currently unimplemented) for alternative data sources if the primary request fails.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - The raw data is converted into a Pandas DataFrame, with the index set as dates and numeric columns cast to floats.  
   - The dataset is filtered to the specified date range and sorted chronologically.  
   - The `Adjusted Close` column is dropped, and the `Close` price is used as the target variable.  
   - A 70-30 train-test split is applied, with 70% of the data (approximately 2010–2016) used for training and 30% (approximately 2017–2019) reserved for testing.  
   - The data is normalized using a `MinMaxScaler` to scale values between 0 and 1, ensuring compatibility with the LSTM model.  
   - Sequences of 100 days (`seq_length = 100`) are created to predict the next day's price, transforming the data into a 3D format `[samples, time steps, features]` required by LSTM.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Initial visualizations include a plot of AAPL’s closing prices over the decade.  
   - 100-day and 200-day moving averages are calculated and plotted alongside the closing prices to highlight long-term trends and potential trading signals.

4. **Model Architecture**  
   - The LSTM model is built using Keras with the following layers:  
     - **LSTM Layer 1**: 50 units, ReLU activation, returns sequences, followed by 20% dropout.  
     - **LSTM Layer 2**: 60 units, ReLU activation, returns sequences, followed by 30% dropout.  
     - **LSTM Layer 3**: 80 units, ReLU activation, returns sequences, followed by 40% dropout.  
     - **LSTM Layer 4**: 120 units, ReLU activation, followed by 50% dropout.  
     - **Dense Layer**: 1 unit for single-value prediction (next day’s price).  
   - The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, then trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 32.  
   - Dropout layers are included to prevent overfitting, given the complexity of financial time series data.

5. **Prediction and Evaluation**  
   - Test data is prepared by concatenating the last 100 days of training data with the test set, ensuring continuity for sequence-based predictions.  
   - Predictions are generated and inverse-transformed to their original price scale.  
   - Performance is evaluated using MSE, RMSE, and MAE, providing insights into the model’s accuracy and error magnitude.  
   - A visualization compares actual vs. predicted prices over the test period, aligned with corresponding dates.

6. **Future Prediction**  
   - A utility function, `predict_next_day`, uses the last 100-day sequence from the test data to forecast the price for the next day (January 1, 2020).  
   - The result is presented with the predicted date and price.

7. **Result Storage**  
   - A DataFrame containing dates, actual prices, predicted prices, and their differences is created and saved as a CSV file (`stock_prediction_results.csv`) for further analysis or reporting.

Implementation Details
- **Libraries**: The project relies on Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib for visualization, Scikit-learn for scaling and metrics, and Keras (TensorFlow backend) for building the LSTM model.  
- **API Key**: An Alpha Vantage API key is required (users must replace `YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` with a valid key).  
- **Scalability**: The code is modular, with functions like `get_stock_data`, `create_sequences`, and `predict_next_day`, making it adaptable to other stocks or time periods.  
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling is implemented for API requests and file operations.

Results and Visualizations
- **Historical Trends**: The closing price plot with moving averages reveals AAPL’s upward trend from 2010 to 2019, with notable growth acceleration post-2015.  
- **Prediction Plot**: The test period visualization shows how well the model tracks actual prices, though some deviations are expected due to stock market volatility.  
- **Metrics**: MSE, RMSE, and MAE quantify the prediction error, offering a numerical assessment of model performance.  
- **Next-Day Prediction**: A single forecasted price for January 1, 2020, provides a practical application of the model.

Potential Applications
- **Investment Decision Support**: Investors could use the model to identify potential price movements, though it’s not a substitute for professional financial advice.  
- **Algorithmic Trading**: The prediction logic could be integrated into automated trading systems.  
- **Educational Tool**: The project serves as a hands-on example of applying deep learning to financial time series data.  
- **Portfolio Management**: Analysts could extend the model to multiple stocks for broader market insights.

Limitations
- **Data Dependency**: The model relies on historical data and assumes past patterns will persist, which may not hold during market disruptions (e.g., economic crises).  
- **API Constraints**: Alpha Vantage’s free tier has rate limits (e.g., 5 requests per minute), potentially slowing large-scale use.  
- **Overfitting Risk**: Despite dropout layers, the model may overfit noisy financial data, requiring further tuning or regularization.  
- **Single Feature**: Using only the closing price limits the model’s ability to capture broader market signals (e.g., volume, macroeconomic factors).

Future Enhancements
- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate additional features like volume, technical indicators (RSI, MACD), or external factors (interest rates, news sentiment).  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize LSTM units, sequence length, epochs, or batch size using grid search or random search.  
- **Real-Time Data**: Integrate live data feeds for continuous predictions.  
- **Ensemble Models**: Combine LSTM with other techniques (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) for improved accuracy.  
- **Multi-Step Prediction**: Extend the model to forecast multiple days ahead.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a practical application of LSTM neural networks for stock price prediction, using AAPL as a case study. By blending data science, deep learning, and financial analysis, it provides a foundation for exploring predictive modeling in the stock market. While not intended for real-world trading without further validation, it offers valuable insights into time series forecasting and serves as a stepping stone for more advanced financial modeling endeavors.
